                    <p class="text-light">To become a graphic designer, you will need to have IT and drawing skills. You'll need to be able to find practical solutions to problems. You'll also need excellent communication skills. <br> <br><br>Most professional graphic designers have a foundation degree, HND or degree in graphic design or other art and design-based subject. You will also need a working knowledge of desktop design software, such as Illustrator, InDesign or QuarkXPress, and image-editing packages such as Photoshop. You can do courses in these at colleges, private training providers and through self-study.</p><br><br><br>

                    <p class="text-light">An employer will be as interested in your design skills and creative ideas as they are in your qualifications. Talent and personal contacts (networking) are very important for getting work. You will need to have an up-to-date portfolio to show potential employers what you can do. Donâ€™t be afraid to use your design skills (where appropriate) to make your CV stand out. <br><br><br>Unpaid work experience, holiday jobs and internships will give you the chance to develop your portfolio, make contacts and impress employers. You could also create a website to showcase your work.</p><br><br><br>
                    <p class="text-light">Competition for jobs is strong and not all jobs are advertised, so as well as building contacts, you could approach companies and design agencies directly. A good starting point is to search for design agencies in the design directory of the British Design Innovation website. <br><br><br>You may be able to become a junior graphic designer through an apprenticeship scheme. You will need to check which schemes are available in your area. </p><br><br><br>
